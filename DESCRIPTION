Description: A comprehensive framework for analyzing positive continuous data based on multivariate 
    Box-Cox symmetric distributions generated by a normal scale mixture copula. The marginal
    regression setting enables the joint modeling of univariate observations, resembling generalized
    estimating equation models. This approach offers considerable flexibility and applies to
    different data structures, including independent observations, time series, longitudinal data,
    clustered data, and spatially correlated data. The package provides robust tools for fitting and
    assessing goodness-of-fit across a variety of dependence structures.
